Introduction
-seabirds are an important top predator in marine environment
-some small seabirds, like terns, are central place foragers that consume transient fishes
-knowledge surrounding forage fishes is lacking

-here, we explore tern diet over 20+ years with an eye toward their use as bioindicators
