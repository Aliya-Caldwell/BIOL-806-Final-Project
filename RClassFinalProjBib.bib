	abstract = {This paper reviews the use of seabirds in ﬁsheries management around the world, and provides a comprehensive overview of the many factors that should be considered in order to identify the most appro priate species and parameters. There are a growing number of examples where seabird monitoring programs are providing valuable information on the health of particular ﬁsh stocks, the health of the ecosystem, and on the effects of climatic change. Despite this, their suitability and usefulness as ecological performance indicators is still being developed in many marine systems. This is due largely to the many challenges involved in identifying the direct links between changes in prey composition and availability and measurable components of seabird ecology. A species ability to respond and cope with changing environmental conditions differs due to the combined inﬂuence of their time/energy budget, dietary preferences, and speciﬁc life-history traits. These factors should be considered in order to identify the most suitable species to monitor, given their level of sensitivity or resilience to a given level of change. The most useful ranges of adult, chick, breeding or population parameters are outlined, and examples are provided of their application to ﬁsheries management as environmental, ecological and ﬁsheries-based indicators. The value of seabird data in investigating the mechanisms underlying the population dynamics of prey species is also discussed, and areas of future research suggested. By integrating information on this topic this review will assist future studies in identifying the most appropriate species and suite of parameters that are most appropriate to monitor, in order to detect potential environmental and ﬁsheries related impacts. This review also outlines many of the uncertainties that must be considered before they are applied as ecological performance indicators and management tools.},

So just gotta keep in mind that this is 12 years old, so theres definitely more that has been accomplished since this review was written
Uncertainty about seabirds usefulness because each species responds differently to fluctuations in the composition and availability of their prey. Also, species differ in their response to changes in prey density.

Need an understanding of the functional relationship between seabird parameters and food supply


Identifying good indicator species

Species reflects conditions at the same spatial scale as the fishery operates
Obviously more sensitive species are gonna be capable of showing smaller changes in fish populations
We have to understand seabird dietary preference, foraging capability, and time/energy budget in order to understand how they will respond to fluctuations in prey availability
Specialists are less likely to prey switch, therefore they are often better indicators for their prey species of choice
Surface feeders are better than pursuit feeders cuz they’re typically more constrained
Generalists are more reflective of prey assemblage (cuz they sample the most abundant species from a range of trophic levels)
The relative abundance of different prey species is sometimes poorly reflected in specialists because they will likely overrepresent their favorite prey types

If we know by how much they overrepresent though then this doesn’t matter


Discussed breeding parameters, chick parameters, and population parameters that can be used to reflect food availability

But obviously, directly measuring diet is the best/most direct way to do this


Conclusions

More sensitive species have: restricted diet, relatively small foraging range, inflexible time/energy budget, and if they are surface feeders
Less sensitive species have: generalist diet, large range, higher time/energy flexibility, and higher diving capabilities
Both more and less sensitive species can be indicators if you use them correctly

	title = {The foraging decisions of a central place foraging seabird in response to fluctuations in local prey conditions},
	abstract = {During reproduction, seabirds need to balance the demands of self- and offspringprovisioning within the constraints imposed by central place foraging. To assess behavioral adjustments and tolerances to these constraints, we studied the feeding tactics and reproductive success of common murres (also known as common guillemots) Uria aalge, at their largest and most offshore colony (Funk Island) where parents travel long distances to deliver a single capelin Mallotus villosus to their chicks. We assessed changes in the distance murres traveled from the colony, their proximate foraging locations and prey size choice during two successive years in which capelin exhibited an order of magnitude decrease in density and a shift from aggregated (2004) to dispersed (2005) distributions. When capelin availability was low (2005), parental murres increased their maximum foraging distances by 35\% (60 to 81 km) and delivered signiﬁcantly larger capelin to chicks, as predicted by central place foraging theory. Murres preferred large (4140 mm) relative to small capelin (100–140 mm) in both years, but unexpectedly this preference increased as the relative density of large capelin decreased. We conclude that single prey-loading murres target larger capelin during long foraging trips as parents are ‘forced’ to select the best prey for their offspring. Low ﬂedgling masses suggest also that increased foraging time when capelin is scarce may come at a cost to the chicks (i.e. fewer meals per day). Murres at this colony may be functioning near physiological limits above which further or sustained adjustments in foraging effort could compromise the life-time reproductive success of this long-lived seabird.},

	abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that recent oceanographic changes associated with climate change in the Northeast United States continental shelf ecosystem have caused a change in spatial distribution of marine fish. To do this, we analyzed temporal trends from 1968 to 2007 in the mean center of biomass, mean depth, mean temperature of occurrence, and area occupied in each of 36 fish stocks. Temporal trends in distribution were compared to time series of both local- and large-scale environmental variables, as well as estimates of survey abundance. Many stocks spanning several taxonomic groups, life-history strategies, and rates of fishing exhibited a poleward shift in their center of biomass, most with a simultaneous increase in depth, and a few with a concomitant expansion of their northern range. However, distributional changes were highly dependent on the biogeography of each species. Stocks located in the southern extent of the survey area exhibited much greater poleward shifts in center of biomass and some occupied habitats at increasingly greater depths. In contrast, minimal changes in the center of biomass were observed in stocks with distributions limited to the Gulf of Maine, but mean depth of these stocks increased while stock size decreased. Largescale temperature increase and changes in circulation, represented by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, was the most important factor associated with shifts in the mean center of biomass. Stock size was more often correlated with the total area occupied by each species. These changes in spatial distribution of fish stocks are likely to persist such that stock structure should be re-evaluated for some species.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of ecological systems include a bewildering number of biotic interactions that unfold over a vast range of spatial scales. Here, employing simple and general empirical arguments concerning the nature of movement, trophic position and behaviour we outline a general theory concerning the role of space and food web structure on food web stability. We argue that consumers link food webs in space and that this spatial structure combined with relatively rapid behavioural responses by consumers can strongly influence the dynamics of food webs. Employing simple spatially implicit food web models, we show that large mobile consumers are inordinately important in determining the stability, or lack of it, in ecosystems. More specifically, this theory suggests that mobile higher order organisms are potent stabilizers when embedded in a variable, and expansive spatial structure. However, when space is compressed and higher order consumers strongly couple local habitats then mobile consumers can have an inordinate destabilizing effect. Preliminary empirical arguments show consistency with this general theory.},

	abstract = {Collapses of high-energy dense concentrations of prey species induce negative effects on populations of top predators. Knowledge of prey quality appears to be crucial in ecosystem modelling and management. The aim here was to provide baseline data of forage species quality in the Bay of Biscay. Proximate composition (water, ash, protein, and lipid) and energy content have been determined to assess the quality of 78 species, including jellyﬁsh, crustaceans, cephalopods, cartilaginous ﬁsh, and bony ﬁsh. Results show broad variations between species, with energy densities ranging from 2 to 10 kJ g21. Lipids are the most structuring component and largely determined prey quality, and prey species are not necessarily interchangeable for the fulﬁlment of a predator’s energy and food requirements. In ecosystem models, therefore, multispecies compartments of forage organisms would ideally be constituted using prey species of equivalent quality and hence of equivalent beneﬁt to top predators.},

	abstract = {Piscivorous predators can experience multi-fold differences in energy intake rates based solely on the types of fishes consumed. We estimated energy density of 1151 fish from 39 species by proximate analysis of lipid, water, ash-free lean dry matter, and ash contents and evaluated factors contributing to variation in composition. Lipid content was the primary determinant of energy density, ranging from 2 to 61\% dry mass and resulting in a five-fold difference in energy density of individuals (2.0–10.8 kJg−1 wet mass). Energy density varied widely within and between species. Schooling pelagic fishes had relatively high or low values, whereas nearshore demersal fishes were intermediate. Pelagic species maturing at a smaller size had higher and more variable energy density than pelagic or nearshore species maturing larger. High-lipid fishes had less water and more protein than low-lipid fishes. In some forage fishes, size, month, reproductive status, or location contributed significantly to intraspecific variation in energy density. Differences in quality are sufficient to potentially affect diet selection of breeding seabirds, especially when transporting food for their young to the nest site.},
